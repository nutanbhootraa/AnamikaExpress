                    Winning should not be an ultimate goal, learning should be. <br/>

                    Keeping this in mind, I participated in "International speech contest" in my club. My topic was: An Unsuitable Girl. <br/>
                    A lot of people helped me prepare the speech, gave feedback on how I can improve my speech and different delivery aspects. <br/>

                    Presenting on an actual stage was real fun, rather than on an online platform.

                    My biggest achievement during this competition is, I had the courage to on stage and competed against some super awesome speakers. <br/>

                    When you take learning as fun, you can go above and beyond. <br/>
