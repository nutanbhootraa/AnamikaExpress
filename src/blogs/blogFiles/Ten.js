                    Until a few years ago, when anyone used to be sad, and we called it sadness. Recently, we are more educated about mental health.<br/><br/>

                    After the sudden demise of late actor Sushant Singh Rajput, everyone suddenly started talking about mental health.
                    It’s a hot topic of the current generation. More celebrities came out and shared about their journey about how they dealt with depression.
                    Depression word became more common in our regular life.<br/><br/>

                    <b>“You don’t have to be positive all the time. It’s perfectly okay to feel sad, angry, annoyed, frustrated, scared, and anxious. Having feelings doesn’t make you a negative person.
                        It makes you human.” — Lori Deschene<br/><br/></b>
                    </Grid>

                    I agree that mental health is crucial. It becomes even more important when you are living alone and that too in COVID times.<br/><br/>

                    However, today, an eye-opening conversation happened.<br/><br/>

                    I was ranting about my “loneliness” and how I am “struggling” through it. Someone told me: Do you know at these times, mental health is a luxury.<br/><br/>

                    It made me think again.<br/>
                    When people are out of jobs, food, home, and many people dying out there because of a lack of basic resources such as oxygen, ventilators, and medicines.
                    I have every necessary commodity to live along with my family. I can connect with anyone anytime.<br/><br/>

                    So do I need to rant about my survival? Absolutely No.<br/><br/>

                    Is my survival different from others?<br/><br/>

                    Definitely yes, I have the luxury to keep up my mental health in some other ways. I can make my schedule a bit tighter.
                    I can do yoga, I can join some hobby classes, and I can read books. I can follow my passion.<br/><br/>

                    Additionally, definitely yes because I can’t compare my loneliness with the scarcity of food, home, medicine, and Oxygen.<br/><br/>

                    At this given moment, we have two options:<br/>
                    A step forward to make ourselves happy and keep everyone safe<br/>
                    or<br/>
                    To make everyone suffer.<br/><br/>

                    The choice is ours.<br/><br/>

                    <Grid align="left" style={{paddingLeft:'5%'}}>

                    Stay home. Stay safe. Stay sane.<br/><br/>
