                    “Your skirt provoked them”… seriously… a 3 year old kid was not wearing skirt right. Then why she got raped. A 86 years old lady has not wore skirt then why she is victim. Her husband raped her. It’s not short skirt which provoked you it’s narrow mind and poor upbringing of rapists as well as supporters of them. Bhaiya najaria badlo najara apne aap badal jaega.<br/><br/>

                    “You came outside after 6 P.M.”… You too came after 6 P.M. have I raped you or molested you? Then why Damini was victim. Why 31 girls of bengaluru were molested on new year eve. Why only girls hostels have curphew? Boys should have curfew so that we can roam around everywhere freely anytime.<br/><br/>

                    “You should tell bhaiya then he will not rape you”… bhaiya ispe muh na khulvae..An uncle tried to use his own niece. she was like  his daughter then why she was a victim.<br/><br/>

                    “You should not oppose while somebody is trying to rape you”… Wah re netaji.. Taj mehel to hain nahin ki koi bhi aae or uski khubsurat nakkashi ko chumta rahe or bichara taj mehel kuch bol na pae, Jeete jagte insan hain. Itni simple bat samjh nahi aai abtk aapko.<br/><br/>

                    “They both were in objectionable position so her father murdered her–Aarushi murder case”. You could not find any clue so you thought it’s very easy story to makeup, blame on girl’s character and so called “MEN-ORIENTED” society will believe you and you won. Is that her fault that you failed in investigation? Then why a big question mark on her character? <br/><br/>

                    “They both were sitting in inappropriate manner” A rapist said in an interview.. Bhai teko agar itni samajh hoti baithne ke tarike ki to tu aisi harkat karta hi nahi.<br/><br/>

                    “You should not talk to boys”. You know what? This kind of people should not talk to anyone and should be locked so that nobody will get harm.<br/><br/>

                    “Vogue is bullshit”. A video picturized on women’s life is simply bullshit because you can not digest how someone is raising voice for women empowerment.<br/><br/>

                    “Sita aap agni pariksha de tab hamare sath chalie” .. Kyu swami aap bhi to door the aao hum dono dete hai agni pariksha — This should have been sita’s words.<br/>
                    You should do this you should do that.<br/><br/>

                    There is a pre-defined protocol for girls how to behave, what to wear, what to tell and so on. Every rule is made by some male species. May be my thoughts will hurt your “EGO”. Every possible option you try to make a girl’s life hell. Female foeticide is first option for you. If by chance she takes birth then her education is a very big issue. Or kinhi reasons se padha bhi lia then you should follow these stupid protocols of clothes, outing, friends etc. And then ultimate goal Marriage. After that you are husband’s private property.<br/><br/>

                    A special request to everyone. If you can’t help in anything then please atleast stay out of girl’s life so that they can help themselves.<br/><br/>

                    Always remember strong man can never do this kind of cheap stuff only a weak man will do<br/><br/>
