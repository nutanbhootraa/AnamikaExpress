                    Quit India<br/><br/>

                    After 100s of movements, 1000s of soldiers’ lives, and 200 years of slavery We Indians finally got independence on 15th August 1947, For which we will be forever grateful to the freedom fighters.
                    Independence is like a crossword puzzle, which has many levels. We have unlocked the 1st level of independence before 73 years.<br/>
                    We have crossed many levels since then.<br/>
                    We became a democratic country. We have the power to create and destroy powers. Instead of people working for a king, it’s us working for us by us.
                    Our constitution is the longest constitution in the world. Which contains 444 articles, 12 schedules, 124 amendments with 146385 words.
                    We have so many world heritage sites which make us stronger in terms of tourism.
                    November 5, 2013, was marked as one of the most significant days in Indian history. with lift-off, Our mars orbiter mission spacecraft, India’s first interplanetary mission was executed.

                    We have our own supercomputers. Cray xc40 pratyush and mihir are India’s fastest supercomputers which are in top500 supercomputer list.
                    And the list goes on and on...<br/><br/>

                    But many levels yet to be unraveled.<br/><br/>

                    Today I will talk about a few aspects of complete independence.<br/><br/>

                    It was May 2009. We were traveling to Kedarnath. From Beautiful mountains to heavenly scenery, we were about to reach our destination. In between, we saw a Dhaba and took a small hold for lunch. We sat there and one of my friends goes: oye chotu idhar aa(hey kid come here) to one of the kids working there.<br/>
                    He came with the menu and took our order.<br/>
                    He brought our food in a few minutes. While eating we bugged that chotu many times. Chotu bring salt, Chotu bring extra bread and whatnot.<br/>
                    He patiently took all of our orders.<br/>
                    Before leaving a small thought hit us: In this 1 hour nobody asked that chotu, whether he is studying, whether he wants to work or not, why is he working at this tender age, whether he is the only earning member of his family.<br/>
                    There are 1000s of chotus in our country who need to set free so that they can study, they can get their basic rights to fulfill their duties.<br/>
                    a step forward towards complete independence would be no kids working.<br/><br/>

                    April 2011, a very brilliant friend of mine and his roommate, were preparing for IIT JEE. Both were hard working. Both had the same resources and privileges. Both had studied together day and night. When the results came, both got the same marks. But one of them got IIT Kanpur, a very prestigious college, and another did not. Can you imagine why? “Reservation”. Reservation has killed talent for so many years. I am not telling reservation should be completely eliminated, but it should be given to them who actually deserve not based on caste system but based on economic status.
                    a step forward towards complete independence would be fair and equal opportunities to the youth, based on talent not on the reservation.<br/><br/>

                    July 2015,<br/>
                    my friend was getting married. Everyone was happy on the occasion, nobody asked for dowry. On the marriage day, when the groom’s family arrived, we have done all the rituals to welcome them. Just before the marriage, they said they don’t want anything for themselves. They just wanted us to give gold coins to every person who came with them, as this is a matter of their prestige.
                    Her father could not say yes or no. His daughter’s entire life was on the stake on the other hand his image in society.<br/>
                    a step forward towards complete independence would be no dowry or “gifts” in marriages.<br/><br/>

                    July 2017,<br/>
                    My cousin was getting engaged. she has a Ph.D. on the day of engagement her in-laws told us she can’t work after marriage. Because they are super-rich and their daughter and daughter-in-law don’t need to work.<br/>
                    People need to understand that a person does not work to only earn money, it involves dignity, self-respect, and pride. A girl’s parents invest money and time so that their daughter can be successful.
                    one more step towards complete independence would be for daughters to be set free to do what they want not what they are told.<br/><br/>

                    For our society, before 25 years, we are single. After 25 years we are unmarried.<br/>
                    September 2017, It was a friend’s birthday(25th birthday). and his family started searching for a suitable bride. but he did not want to marry and did not give any reason to his family.<br/>
                    after so much bugging he came out of the closet and told his friends that he is gay and now is worried because that’s illegal in this country and how his parents will react.<br/>
                    finally 6th Sept 2018, the day came when section 377 became unconstitutional. But his worries did not lessen. As he still did not know how his family would react. He finally told his family about his preferences. His family surprisingly accepted it being a very conservative family.
                    A step forward towards complete independence would be we accept people as they are.<br/><br/>

                    These are the few levels of the crossword to achieve true and completely independent India.
                    As Ratan Tata once said: I do not want India to be an economic superpower. I want India to be a happy country.<br/><br/>

                    I believe when everyone will get equal opportunities to become happy, they will automatically try India to be a happy and completely independent country.<br/><br/>

                    Jai hind. <br/>
