                    It was December 2015, for my winter vacation from college. I decided to go home by flight.
                    I was so excited as this was my 1st-time experience in flight.
                    As soon as I have booked the ticket, I started packing my luggage, packed 2 bags, 1 laptop bag, 1 carry bag, and whatnot, as you all know how much we, girls, like to carry with us.
                    When my friend came to my room, she said, I think only 15 kilograms are allowed in flight please check and unpack everything.
                    When I checked, she was right.
                    I could only carry 15 kilograms in baggage and 7 kilograms with me in a carry bag.
                    I unpacked everything and kept only important stuff in bag.<br/><br/>


                    On the day of the journey: my flight was at 7 P.m., I got ready at 6 A.M.  to go to the airport. I called my friend: Hey, I am leaving for the airport. Can you come to my room?<br/><br/>

                    She was shocked.<br/><br/>

                    She: Dude, your flight time is at 7 P.M., why on earth at 6 A.M. you are leaving. Just sleep and let others sleep.<br/><br/>

                    I left the hostel by noon and reached the airport, thoroughly checked in, gave my luggage. Here comes the security check.<br/>
                    I knew I did not have anything illegal or anything that can block my security check pass, but still, I was going through immense anxiety and sweat. When the lady asked me to come for checking, my heart rate was 170 and In my subconscious mind, I was thinking, what if in my pocket, suddenly a bomb appears.<br/><br/>

                    Anyway, I passed the security check and waited for 7 P.M. each second was passing like a year. Finally, I boarded my flight. I was so happy. I clicked selfie to post on social media because otherwise, the flight could not have taken off. I was very excited till then. suddenly I got shocked with safety briefings.<br/><br/>

                    <i>Ladies and gentlemen, please read the safety instructions card placed in your seat pocket in front.
                        Fasten your seatbelt by inserting the metal clip into the buckle and tighten it like this.
                        To open lift the buckle.
                        In case of low cabin pressure, oxygen masks will drop automatically from the panel above.
                        Cover your nose and mouth. Please wear your masks first before assisting others.
                        There are 8 emergency exits in this aircraft. 2 forward, 2 rear and 2 over the wings on both sides.
                        The nearest exit can also be behind you. Escape marking system will help to reach nearest helping system.
                        In case of an emergency landing, life vests are under the seats.</i><br/><br/>

                    Emergency Exits. Like what will happen, we will be 10000 meters up from the ground and I will be asked to leave?
                    <Twemoji svg text="ðŸ˜³ðŸ˜³"/> I was not told about this. Oxygen mask, why I will need an oxygen mask. Emergency landing in water. OMG, I donâ€™t know how to swim.
                    <Twemoji svg text="ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­"/> Wasnâ€™t this your duty to make my journey safe?<br/><br/>

                    Nevertheless, I Put my cell phone on flight mode, tray table up , window open. Didnâ€™t have any other option.<br/><br/>

                    While I was panicking, my fellow passenger did not care at all what she was saying.<br/>
                    He had his kid with him. Very cute kid.<br/>
                    My request to all who traveled or will travel with a kid, please make sure your kid does not annoy other passengers.<br/><br/>

                    The passenger next to me had a kid, initially, he only pulled his fatherâ€™s hair and asked for some toy.
                    But after some time, he started annoying me. He was a real patience-tester.
                    I slept in 15-20 minutes, he started poking me. 2 or 3 times I ignored him, but then I told his father, please take care of your kid.<br/>
                    I donâ€™t really blame the kid for that, if his father had attended to him properly, he would have not annoyed me.
                    When the food came, the kid has spilled everything everywhere and his father did not utter a single word to him. I have booked the window seat, and the kid was all over me when he wanted to look out of the window. One hell out of experience with that kid.
                    It was 30 minutes on the plane, this kid has started a video in full volume. and whenever his father tried taking the phone or to reduce the volume, he cried in the volume higher than the video. If that was not enough that kid was kicking the seat in front of him and annoying other passengers too.<br/><br/>

                    Somehow, I completed this rollercoaster journey with the kid, his father and panic attacks.<br/>
