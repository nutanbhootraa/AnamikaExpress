                    Are re isko kyu padha rahe ho, ye to paraya dhan hai.Ye kaise kapde penne hain .Aap isko itni rat ko bahar jana allow kyu karte ho..<br/><br/>

                    Roughly translates to:<br/>
                    Why are you letting her study? she is someone else’s property. What are you wearing?
                    Why are you allowing her to roam around at this hour of the night? I have heard these lines for myself.<br/><br/>

                    If you have heard these lines for yourself, sister, cousin, friend, neighbor, or someone you might just know, then this is a perfect time, my friend, you take the initiative to change society, family, and inner self.<br/><br/>

                    Hello friends,<br/>
                    As a daughter, wife, mother I have many responsibilities which I have completed honestly without taking sick leaves, but as a woman I demand my freedom now. I used the word demand because though India got independence before 73 years, I am not free. Am I? Today I will tell my story as a daughter, wife, mother, and more importantly, a woman.<br/><br/>

                    My name is Dayavanti.<br/>
                    Today it’s my 60th birthday. All the preparations for the evening party have been done. Everyone is happy except me. It’s been 6 months since the incident. I was alone at home and he came home. My nephew came home to take care of me. But who knew he will take my advantage.<br/><br/>

                    I was always told if you wear short clothes or drink alcohol or roam around at night then these things will happen to you. But I was at home, wearing a sari, with Bhagavad Gita by my side table. Everyone told me to stay mum.<br/><br/>

                    Every night I lie awake,<br/>
                    Wondering how much I can take.<br/>
                    Maybe I could have ended it all<br/>
                    And still, be able to stand tall<br/>
                    But enough is enough<br/>
                    Tonight I will stay tough<br/>
                    And maybe for once, they will see<br/>
                    That they can no longer hurt me<br/>
                    Let me breathe, please set me free.<br/><br/>

                    My name is Maya.<br/>
                    You know how I got these scars.<br/>
                    Yesterday when my husband came home drunk and found me sleeping, this was his way to ask for food.
                    When he first did this, I went directly to my father’s place and told him, I will never go there.
                    I want a formal police complaint. My father got angry. I thought, this is it.
                    I don’t have to go there again.
                    My father looked into my eyes and told me: look these things happen in marriages, but you have to take care of your family. That’s your family. Go and serve them.<br/><br/>

                    Even to this day, I will never forgive you<br/>
                    And I’ll never forget all that I went through<br/>
                    So I hope you feel like I did, broken and upset<br/>
                    you live every last day, all filled with regret<br/>
                    And maybe for once, you will see<br/>
                    That you can no longer hurt me<br/>
                    Let me breathe, please set me free.<br/><br/>

                    My name is Aastha<br/>
                    I remember the day when everyone praised me for 1st rank in the class. I got my first cycle.
                    Years passed by. This April I will be giving my 10th board exams and today I am getting married.
                    I have decided to run away.<br/>

                    My aspirations choked, my desires killed<br/>
                    I am poked, leaving it pain-filled.<br/>
                    I love I care<br/>
                    I nurture I dare<br/>
                    No, This is not the age to be romantic<br/>
                    No, I can’t sit and watch while my future sinks like titanic<br/>
                    And maybe for once, you will see<br/>
                    That you can no longer hurt me<br/>
                    Let me breathe, please set me free.<br/><br/>

                    I don’t have a name.<br/>
                    I am not yet born. Yesterday I heard my Mumma papa’s conversation.
                    They were going to the hospital for some tests. I think it is for my health.
                    How much they care for me.<br/>
                    I can’t wait to come home.
                    But why they are fighting now? Am I not healthy? Let me listen.
                    Oh no, why you want to kill me, I will be a good child. Please mom please dad let me come. let me see the world.<br/><br/>

                    You show me the knife<br/>
                    And deprive me of life<br/>
                    I too wanna live<br/>
                    There is nothing that I cannot do<br/>
                    There is nothing that I cannot achieve<br/>
                    I have a dream, A dream to belong<br/>
                    Sing my beautiful song<br/>
                    Please do not make this mistake<br/>
                    See me and let me awake.<br/><br/>

                    It is time we revolt, give back, and fight!<br/>
                    It is time to put all the wrong things right!<br/>
                    Raise your voice, Vocalise your opinion,<br/>
                    Defend injustice, help the girl child to reach a new pavilion!<br/><br/>

                    And maybe for once, everyone will see<br/>
                    That no one can no longer hurt me<br/>
                    Let me breathe, please set me free.<br/>
