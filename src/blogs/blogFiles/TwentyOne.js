                    When I was in 12th standard. I prepared day & night for IIT JEE with 1.3 million others but still did not get enough marks to get admission into IIT.
                    I have seen every possible reaction after that.<br/>
                    <b>
                    <i>Not everyone gets an IIT. Anyway, she is a girl, does not matter where she studies when her goal is to marry and settle down. Don't worry beta you will get it next year. You have given your best and that's what matters.</i>
                    </b>
                    <br/>
                    It continued for an entire month until AIEEE results were announced. That day I have decided not to give IIT another chance and get whatever AIEEE college I will get.
                    I have never regretted this decision because I knew, what if I don't get enough marks next year too, I did not want to go through everything again, and if I get a good college then I can do whatever I wished to do in IIT. <br/>
                    I did not do anything there too, but that's an entirely different matter. <Twemoji svg text=" :P :P" />

                    After entering college, a year passed with all fun & chill. <br/>
                    On my 18th birthday, I received a call from an old school friend. there onwards, we became good friends. 1st-month chats, 2nd-month calls, and so on. After some time we entered into the relationship. Initially, everything was very fairy tale-y. Chocolates, gifts, late-night calls blah blah. <br/>
                    However, slowly that turned into small fights, big fights, and then bigger & immature fights. One fine day we decided to break up. We decided to move on with a failed relationship and a successful friendship. I don't regret it. Not then, not now. <br/>
                    Some people can be friends for a lifetime, but not a partner you seek for. It's been years now and I promote breakups now.  <Twemoji svg text=" :P :P" /> <br/><br/>

                    When I was doing my masters. Our placement drive started. A small background: I really did nothing in my undergrad, not even a single internship. <br/>
                    Day 0: a few companies came. I had my 1st interview & got rejected. 2nd company interviews were going on & in all nervous/excited feeling I cleared all the rounds, but the hiring team from that company told our placement officer: we want to give her an internship offer now, as she does not have any internship till now and if all goes well then we will give her a full-time job. <br/>
                    Again time to decide if I accept this offer then I can't sit further in any company. I decided to reject the offer and I don't regret it because the same day I got another offer bigger and better. <br/><br/>
                    These are just a few examples of my failures. I have had a fair share of failures in my life in studies, love, job, etc. I fail on a regular day-to-day basis. <br/>
                    For the 100 zillion times, I have decided to hit the gym but I did not and successfully gained 10 kgs and all my 4 inches do not regret it. <br/>
                    Every day I decide to take 8 hours of beauty sleep but instead, I get 10-12 hours of zombie sleep <Twemoji svg text=" :P" /> <br/>
                    Every day I decide to eat healthy but... <br/><br/>
                    There are all kinds of ifs and buts coated failures here and there but no regrets at all for any of my decisions that I took after those failures, thoroughly thought & calculated decisions. <br/>
                    Because I know, whatever happens, happens for good & I am in a better position right now in every aspect if I had chosen otherwise.
