                    The perfect culmination of history, myth, and imagination. I really liked the way all the Mahabharata‚Äôs characters‚Äô stories are portrayed from Draupadi‚Äôs view, be it Pandava‚Äôs, Bheeshma‚Äôs, or Karna‚Äôs. I could not resist believing some of the myths and imaginary scenarios the author has put in the book :
                    <br/> Myth 1) Draupadi says Kunti was a dangerous and manipulative woman
                    <br/>  Myth 2) Draupadi got the sight to see the war
                    <br/>   Myth 3) Karna spared all the brothers except Arjuna because of the guilt to kill Abhimanyu. (In Mahabharata, He promised Kunti he won‚Äôt kill anyone else except Arjuna).
                    <br/>   Myth 4) At the deathbed of Bheeshma, Karna and Bheeshma had the heart to heart conversation ( In Mahabharata, it was actually with Krishna)
                    <br/>
                    <br/> Being a regular reader and a huge fan of Mahabharata some of the myths which I did not like:
                    <br/> 1) Draupadi and Karna‚Äôs longing for each other.
                    <br/> 2) In swayamvar, Draupadi was in veil. I don‚Äôt remember reading it anywhere in Mahabharata about women in the veil.
                    <br/>
                    <br/> Overall a beautiful story of ‚Äúoffspring of vengeance‚Äù to a ‚Äútrue queen‚Äù to a ‚Äúdestroyer‚Äù and her views.
