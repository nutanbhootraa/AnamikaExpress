                    Kuch Kuch Hota hai is one of the iconic movies in Indian cinema. It portraits the chemistry between three people, Selfish Rahul, Dumb Anjali, and Hot Tina.<br/><br/>

                    Summary:<br/>
                    <b>They were together in college. Rahul and Anjali were best friends forever. Anjali loved Rahul. Rahul and Tina loved each other. They got married and had a kid together, named them Anjali. Tina wrote 8 letters to little Anjali. Tina died. Little Anjali read those letters and united Rahul and Anjali(who became hot now and ditched her fianc√©, Aman).
                        Happy ending.</b><br/><br/>

                    In the entire movie, it was focused on ‚ÄúPyar Ek bar hota hai, shadi bhi ek bar hoti hai‚Äù, selfish Rahul got married twice.<br/><br/>

                    Post their wedding:<br/><br/>


                    Rahul was happy as he got married AGAIN. Anjali was happy as she got her LOVE.<br/>
                    Little Anjali was happy as she completed a roadies task.<br/>
                    Rahul and Anjali had a baby together after a year, named her Tina <Twemoji svg text="üòà"  /> <br/><br/>

                    Till then everything was good, but then comes comparison. Tina used to do this, Aman used to do that(just ex‚Äôs thing).<br/>
                    Anjali & Rahul did not have time for each other anymore. Because they were busy changing Tina‚Äôs diapers.<br/><br/>

                    Rahul and Anjali loved Tina more or little Anjali thought so, she got jealous of that. She left home with Dadi (Rahul‚Äôs mother) because ‚Äúsauteli maa to sauteli hoti hai‚Äù.<br/><br/>

                    Rahul & Anjali fought more often because that‚Äôs what married people do. Their daily routine: wake up, have breakfast, fight, Rahul goes to office, Anjali does household chores(not being sexist here, as Anjali left college in between the term she didn‚Äôt do anything further) along with their 15 servants, Anjali goes to parties, Rahul comes home, have dinner, fight, sleep.<br/><br/>

                    It‚Äôs been 15 years now since their marriage, they have the same routine. Rahul is a billionaire now (Nobody knew what Rahul did for a living and had a briefcase all the time with him). Anjali does not want to live with Rahul. So they are getting a divorce (billionaire‚Äôs rule of thumb). Anjali is asking for 50% alimony <Twemoji svg text="ü§ëü§ë" />. Little Tina is studying in London ( Karan johar thing) and became an Instagram influencer.<br/>
                    Nobody knows what happened to little Anjali.<br/><br/>

                    In the pandemic, Rahul does not know how to cook or do basic household chores, because he always had a mother to do that (first his own, then Tina, then Little Anjali, then Anjali). Anjali does not have money now(divorce did not happen yet so did the alimony<Twemoji svg text=" üòú"/>) <br/><br/>

                    Will Anjali get divorce and alimony? Will Rahul learn to do household chores or will he get married again? How is Tina doing in heaven or hell (for naming her kid after the name of her husband‚Äôs TRUE love) What happened to little Anjali? Will little Tina be the hottest chick of her college, like her mother? <br/><br/>

                    To know all these answers watch kuch kuch hota hai part 20.<br/><br/>
