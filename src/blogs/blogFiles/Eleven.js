                    Once upon a time in Mahabharata, there was a princess named Kunti. She was exquisite and hardworking. Once she has served a saint named Durvasa.
                    He gave her a boon and told her if she recites this mantra and calls any god, then she will get a son.<br/><br/>

                    A few days later, she thought she has forgotten that mantra so just to recall she recited that mantra with a god named Surya that means sun.
                    God Surya appeared and gave her a son with kavach (a body con) and kundal (an earring), which had powers. Now the dilemma was she was not married.
                    She cried in front of god Surya what society will talk about an unmarried mother and a son born out of wedlock, but he was bound to the boon. After he left, she decided to excuse her son in the river.<br/><br/>

                    After a few years, when she got married, she got to know that her husband was born out of wedlock. She thought she has made the mistake of abandoning her son. He might have been accepted.
                    Her husband had a curse on him, that he can’t have children. So she told her husband that she has a boon to get a son from any god. She regretted again not telling her husband about her son.
                    They called different gods and got 5 more children for both of his wives. They were in the jungle at that time and her husband died.<br/><br/>

                    After some time, when they went to the palace, she saw a person with kavach and kundal, named Karna.
                    She immediately knew he was her abandoned son. That day cried out of her motherhood. She wanted to hug him, bless him. However, could not because she thought what society will say.<br/><br/>

                    After some time, when the Mahabharata battle started then Karna was with the army, which was against Kunti’s 5 sons. She did not want her sons to have a battle against each other.
                    So she told lord Krishna, that he should talk to Karna. Krishna told Karna, that Kunti is your mother and all the Pandavas are your brothers.
                    However, he was bound with the friendship of Duryodhana. So he refused to join Pandava’s side.
                    When Kunti talked to him he was on the roller coaster of emotions, but he said, I will only fight Arjuna, not any other brother.
                    O’ mother, you will have your 5 sons after this battle with Either Arjuna or me alive.<br/><br/>

                    On the battlefield, when Karna died, Kunti cried a lot. When everyone got to know, that Karna was Kunti’s eldest son, Yudhisthira, who was now the eldest son, could not bear it.
                    He cursed Kunti that from now onward no woman can keep a secret. Because of your secret, we lost our brother.<br/><br/>

                    And kids, that is why we, women can’t keep secrets.
