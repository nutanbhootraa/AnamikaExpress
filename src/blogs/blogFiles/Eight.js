                    My summer vacation was over, and I had to go back to college. I booked my flight ticket. Woke up early that day, got ready, reached the airport before 4 hours of actual departure, checked in my luggage, crossed the security check. All sorted. My gate number was 45.<br/><br/>

                    I had enough time, so I thought "let’s do the shopping". I started with a clothing store, perfume store, then book store.<br/><br/>

                    Before moving forward, let me just tell you something about myself. I am an avid book reader. I love books. Whenever it comes to books or book reading, I forget my routine. I even forget my meals sometimes. I entered the bookstore, started exploring books, and lost the track of time.<br/><br/>

                    Something about the airport itself. I was at a silent airport where announcements happened only on the TV screen, not verbally.<br/><br/>

                    After some time when I looked into my watch, it was 8:50 A.M. My departure time was at 9:05 A.M. I scurried to gate 45. Everything was calm, and I still had 5 minutes left. I opened a book which I just bought and happily started reading it. At 9:05, I looked around. Nobody was there. I was confused. What might have happened?<br/><br/>

                    I went to the officer standing over there. I have shown him the boarding pass. He said madam, we have changed the gate number. We have emailed and messaged on phone too.<br/><br/>

                    Whatttt… I started panicking. I did not know what to do.
                    He suggested that we should at least try to reach gate number 56, which was almost a light-year far away from gate number 45. Still, I started running towards gate no 56. When I reached it was the time to say bye to the plane.<br/><br/>

                    I missed my flight.<br/><br/>

                    The very 1st thought which should have come to my mind was to go to the counter and check what is time for the next flight but instead what came to my mind 1st: Luggage.<br/><br/>
                    I thought If I missed my flight, they still have my luggage. I went to the counter and told the lady sitting there Please give me my luggage. She said it will take some time for luggage to come back, as it is the time our next flight will depart. I waited there for an hour but they were not at all cooperative.
                    When I asked her for an alternative arrangement, she said they don’t have any seats available on any of the flights that day in their airlines aand others.<br/><br/>

                    I just checked for some other airlines for the ticket by myself. I checked, there were tickets available on some other airlines on the same day that too cheaper. She lied to me. When I confronted her, she said, madam, we can refund you the full amount. Please book by yourself. I just got pissed off. She could have told me earlier. I booked my next flight. I collected my luggage.<br/><br/>

                    I rushed to my gate. I did not do shopping this time. I waited for 7 hours there for my next flight. This time I did not miss my flight.<br/><br/>
