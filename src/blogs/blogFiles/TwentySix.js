                    When my brother was 5 years old, he registered his name to give a speech on Jawahar Lal Nehru.
                    He was given a script appropriate to a 5-year-old. He had prepared very hard for several days.
                    He went on stage and started the speech. <br/>
                    <i>'Jawahar Lal Nehru.. Jawahar Lal Nehru... Jawahar Lal Nehru.... Thank you.'</i> <br/>

                    This incident has stuck with us for the rest of our lives. He has worked every day on his public speaking skills since then.
                    Now he hosts college fests and no family function goes well without him. <br/>

                    Our entire family is really proud of his transformation from being <b>"Shy" <Twemoji svg text="ðŸ˜«"/></b> to being <b>"Secure and confident"<Twemoji svg text="ðŸ”¥"/></b>.
