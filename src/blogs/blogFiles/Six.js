                    Many people wonder who are they? But not many of us know the answer.<br/><br/>

                    Hello everyone, I am gonna tell you who am I?<br/><br/>

                    When I was a kid, I guess 4 years old. My mom and I were sitting on the roof. What my mom was doing I don’t remember and she never told me. But I was counting stars. Believe me there were 117 stars. After all the counts I was wondering from where these stars came? I looked at the whole sky but could not find the origin so I asked my mom : Mom where these stars came from. She, being a non-science person, replied: when people die they become stars and look at those 2 stars(pointing finger at sky) they are my grandparents.<br/><br/>

                    Me : So there is some vehicle that transports the dead people there..<br/><br/>

                    ummm.. let’s go down..<br/><br/>

                    I never got the answer from her.<br/><br/>

                    Fast forward a few years, I was at my grandma’s place. My aunt was on her menstrual cycle. In villages, women can’t touch anything in that period.<br/><br/>

                    It was night 10 p.m. my uncle came from shop and asked for food. I immediately replied without thinking or asking anyone , “she can’t touch food today” and I got scolded somehow. That day nobody told me why I can’t say that. My question was unanswered.<br/><br/>

                    Fast forward a few more years,<br/><br/>

                    I was in 12th standard. My friend, a guy friend called me on my cell phone. It was after a long time we have connected. So we started talking and we lost time. After 20 minutes, my mom came to my room and said : cut the call. It’s been so long you are talking.<br/><br/>

                    This never happened before when I talked to my girl friends. I didn’t know why I was told that way. My question again remained unanswered.<br/><br/>

                    I found a few answers over the time. Stars don’t come from anywhere they are just a reflection of large fireballs, which were there before many years and light-years far away. I was not supposed to talk about periods because it’s taboo in rural areas. I was not supposed to talk to guy friends because my parents thought they were protecting me.<br/><br/>

                    But To date, I have so many questions which were unanswered mostly, how Pythagoras concluded: sum of the squares of base and length is equal to the square of the hypotenuse. Why we restart the program when it doesn’t work the 1st time? Why do people lie on small things? Why people prefer love over money or otherwise. In search of these questions, I found my answer who am I..<br/><br/>

                    I am the curious case of myself finding answers.<br/><br/>
