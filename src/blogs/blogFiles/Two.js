                    I think, this lockdown brought a chef, gym instructor, motivation speaker, etc. out of everyone.<br/><br/>

                    It definitely brought a chef, artist, and sleeping panda out of me.<br/><br/>

                    According to me, human Being’s basic necessities are food, shelter, clothes, education, medicine, and for people like me high speed internet.<br/><br/>


                    Today I will walk you through the stories which changed my perspective towards need vs. want.<br/><br/>

                    It was the 29th of May 2020. Last Friday of the month. 11 A.M., I received a message. “Your account is credited with this amount, on this date by this company”. I was very happy. I lied down on my bed, thinking, what should I buy?<br/>
                    I could not reach to any conclusion, as everything was closed.<br/><br/>

                    I received another text. This time it was from my friend.<br/>
                    Hey, Salary credited. Getting bored in this house. Let’s party hard. #missYou #loveYou #goCoronaGo<br/>
                    I closed my eyes. A series of news from the past few months flashed. Migrants are walking to their hometowns. People are distributing food and essentials to the needy. etc.<br/>
                    There are people out there who don’t have shelter to live, a basic need of the human. On the other hand, I am privileged enough to have a roof of my choice.<br/>

                    Going back a few years. It was April 2004, summer holidays.<br/>
                    I was reading the book. Suddenly, out of nowhere, my mom told me: Nutan, Come. Today I will teach you how to cook.<br/>
                    You can not deny her, as she is the one who is providing you the food.<br/>
                    Anyway, I went to the kitchen. I followed all of her instructions. Put this much water, Knead like this, hold your rolling pin like this. blah blah.<br/>
                    By the end of the session, I made 10 chapatis. I hated that session, from the core of my heart. I had valid reasons.<br/>
                    1) I was 11 years old when none of my friends knew how to use any of the lighters.<br/>
                    2) None of the chapatis were round-shaped.<br/>
                    This torture went on for the entire month. By the end of the month, chapatis were round.<br/><br/>

                    Though I cooked occasionally, My hatred towards cooking grew.<br/>
                    Coming back to 2020, Lockdown started. Day 1, lunchtime, I cooked rice and dal because it is easy to cook. dinner: rice, and dal. 4 days, 8 meals, I had only rice and dal. I, being a foodie, could not take it anymore. Day 5: I was craving for good food. I went to the kitchen. The distance between my bed and kitchen looked like a lightyear. I made chapatis and paneer. everyone might have seen Instagram hashtags for food. After the meal, I had that level of satisfaction.<br/><br/>

                    People out there don’t have a single meal for a day. On the other hand, I am privileged enough to have 2 meals per day of my choice.<br/><br/>

                    After lockdown started, until today, I am in my pajamas. Same 4 pair of T-shirt and pajamas is my need. 400 clothes lying there in my wardrobe is my unused and unnecessary luxury. Some people use 2 pairs of blankets for the entire family in winters. on the other hand, I am privileged enough to wear clothes of my choice.<br/><br/>

                    My mind was full of unfettered thoughts. Suddenly my phone rang. It was my mom. All of my thoughts vanished. I no longer looked privileged. I wanted to hug my mom. I wanted to be with her. We started to talk. 5 minutes, 10 minutes, half an hour. while disconnecting the call, she said, beta, have something to eat before you start off your work.<br/><br/>

                    I suddenly felt so privileged and lucky that I have a mom.<br/><br/>

                    If you are getting salary credited to your account, have food to eat, place to live, friends and family to talk to, believe me my friends you are privileged too.<br/><br/>
