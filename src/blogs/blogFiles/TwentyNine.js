                    It's easier to make jokes about yourself because you know what is coming up. You might get offended for the first time (by yourself of course <Twemoji svg text=":P" />), but after some time, you accept the reality. It is where people come out of their comfort zone.
<br/><br/>
                    One Mic Stand is a perfect example of this. Be it sunny Leone, Chetan Bhagat, or Karan Johar, everyone tried stand-up comedy for the first time. And the one thing I liked the most is they cracked jokes on themselves with absolute ease.
                    <br/>
                    Initially, it looks like your failures, but when you come out of your comfort zone and retrospect things from a different perspective, there is no looking back.

                    Hats off to these 5 non-comedians who came on a public platform and made fun of themselves.
                    <br/><br/>
                    One thing they could have improved is to put some more fresh jokes, say Karan Johar is ranting for 5 minutes about how he only introduces nepo kids or how his career as actor is finished, he could have tried something new.
                    Or Chetan Bhagat talking something else apart from his MBA, bollywood or how his books are not good enough.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Overall one time watch show, it will definitely tickle your funny bone.
