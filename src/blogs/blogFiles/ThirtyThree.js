                    I was not a public speaker. A hidden fear used to be there whenever I talked in front of people. Fear of being judged. Fear of being wrong. I was suggested to join toastmasters.
                    <br/>

                    My clubâ€™s VP-membership called me a few times, she tried to convince me how Toastmasters can help. But I was so underconfident I could not get enrolled. One day I have decided to improve myself and joined Toastmasters. I was allotted a mentor who could guide me. I finally started writing on a clean slate. <br/>

                    Everyoneâ€™s 1st meeting with a toastmasters club is often a see-saw of emotions. <br/>

                    When I attended a few sessions, my first thought was: I will never be this confident in front of people. <br/>

                    Cut to my first speech, It was 10th February 2020, I decided to give a speech upcoming Friday. I have written, rewritten and rewritten my script on Elon musk. I have prepared harder than ever for 5 days so that I donâ€™t fumble when I will be on stage. On Friday, I went office early, read the speech 5 times. Everything was sorted. We gathered for the meeting. I heard the theme of the meet: "Love". and I realized it was 14th February - Valentineâ€™s day. <br/>

                    Anyway, I was nervous but dedicated that I will give this speech. Here comes my additional anxiety, speaker 1. She was also giving her icebreaker. When she started her speech, everyone was lost in her speech. How beautifully she delivered, the hand gestures, the poetry in the script, stage appearance, everything was perfect. My confidence went for a toss. I went to the stage. I started my speech. Stammered multiple times. Completed my speech with trembling legs. <br/>

                    They say, in toastmasters nobody judges you. But here comes the evaluation. Do you think without evaluation we can grow?
                    Thatâ€™s why itâ€™s said: feedback is the breakfast of the champions. <br/>

                    I felt warm, fuzzy, loved, and welcomed with open arms. I remember I couldnâ€™t process the amazement at the ease in my transition from a guest to a toastmaster.
                    I got 1 positive feedback every time. I am a great storyteller. I have decided to build my speaking skills on top of that. Before I knew anything I had everyone at the club guide me and pushing me gently to become better. <br/>

                    I took that feedback seriously. Tried to incorporate every feedback given to me. You can incorporate all the feedback but confidence comes with time and experience. Like this, I gave my 2nd speech an exaggerated story of my childhood. its content was funny but I underperformed again. I got great feedback on content but again was suggested to be more confident.  Like this, I gave 5 speeches. I tried to present all the boring speech projects too in the story form say, understand your communication style or leadership style. Every time I was told to be more confident.  Just 1 major feedback. Be confident. Finally, I gave my L3P3 speech, in that speech I got the feedback that I was looking so confident, that evaluator got impressed.  I was happy finally, that I can work on some other aspects of the speech delivery. My confidence was skyrocketed. <br/>

                    In between, I started taking a few other roles, TMOD, table topics master, timer, linguist. But now I wanted to be an evaluator. I wanted to be a good listener as well not just a good speaker. I started taking evaluator roles. I got some pointers on the evaluation structure, strategy, etc. evaluation is also a speech. So it should have a proper start, body and conclusion. Generally we evaluate a speech in 3 parts. Points that were good, could be better, and the person can challenge himself. Always evaluate speech, not the person. These pointers helped me in real life too. Now when I am a mentor to people I suggest pointers and evaluate their content not them. I never hamper their confidence. <br/>

                    I started giving speeches in external clubs. <br/>

                    I Participated in club-level humorous and international speech contest, evaluation contest, table topic contest. There was no looking back from then. I started participating in international clubs, as this gave me confidence and an opportunity to network. Online meetings gave us that flexibility. I gave a keynote-style long speech in a Canadian club. <br/>

                    I have moderated a panel discussion. It taught me how to handle situations. For example, if the audience is taking much time to respond. or if someone has a question out of scope, etc. <br/>

                    Now when I look back, I feel like it was ages ago when I was an under-confident person. Itâ€™s been a year and half. I have made some amazing friends and met some super awesome speakers. Toastmasters changed a lot in me. It had taught me things I never thought it would. The fact that I did poorly in my icebreaker pushed me to do much better in the next month. <br/>

                    I got a new lease of life through toastmasters. <br/>
