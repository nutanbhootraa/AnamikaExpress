                    Itâ€™s a declarative style of programming. A style of writing computer programs that treat computations as evaluating mathematical functions i.e., an expression that relates an input set to an output set.
                    <br/>
                    It deals with certain key concepts like Pure function, immutable state, assignment less programming etc.<br/>

                    => Functional programming uses <a style={{fontFamily:"Alegreya, serif", color:"green"}}> higher order functions**</a> but often permits mutability at the risk of we failing to do the right things. <br/>

                    => Pure Functional Programming : Functional Programming with immutability.<br/>

                    Java uses Functional Programming whereas Haskell uses Pure Functional Programming<br/>

                    => Lambda Expressions : An anonymous method that has mutability at very minimum and it has only a parameter list and a body.
                    Return type is always inferred based on the context. <br/>

                    (parameters) - > body <br/>

                    Lambdas are stateless. Local variable factor scope must be final or effectively final. <br/>


                    Pure Function : A function is a pure function if it always returns the same result for same argument variables and it has no side effects like modifying an argument or outputting something. <br/>

                    The basic objective of this style of programming is to make code more concise, less complex, more predictable and easier to test compared to the legacy style of coding.<br/>
