                    Effective leaders are not only excellent communicators but also display a high level of personal integrity. They are open-minded, optimistic, and lead by example.<br/>

                    We are all like the 8 legged spiders that walk on 8 different leadership styles. However, unlike the spider, each one of us has a dominant leadership style.
                    We need to understand what type of leader do we choose to develop into.<br/><br/>

                    I have worked in 3 different companies. Strawberry Pvt ltd, Banana Pvt ltd. And mango Pvt ltd.
                    I had 3 different managers, and I wanted to adapt leadership qualities from everyone at the start and become an outstanding leader.<br/><br/>

                    On my 1st day in strawberry Pvt ltd., my manager called me in his cabin and said, list these down.
                    We work on A, B, and C technologies. By our next meeting, please brush up on these concepts.
                    He started giving me a broader picture of the team’s work.
                    After a few days, he called me and said I know you have just joined the organization, but it’s been a month, I don’t see this output.
                    Just remember that I can terminate you, I am the strawberry Pvt ltd for you.<br/><br/>

                    I got confused and thought, is this what leaders do? But I didn’t want to be a boss and hurt people’s sentiments.<br/>

                    I was still searching for my leadership qualities.<br/><br/>

                    When I joined banana Pvt ltd. My manager was a super busy person.
                    But Whenever I needed help, I used to go to him and he solved all my problems.
                    After sometime, I realized I did not learn as much as I had expected from myself.
                    There was someone who spoon-fed me whenever needed. In the end, he did not know what I worked on, what my efforts were in the team.<br/><br/>

                    <img key={1} src={'blogImages/helper.png'} alt="1" width="200" height="200"/> <br/>

                    I was confused once again do I want to be such a leader?<br/>

                    I didn’t want to be a helper. I was still searching for my leadership qualities.<br/><br/>

                    Then comes my 3rd manager, when I joined mango Pvt ltd.
                    My boss introduced me on the 1st day to the entire team and told me to set up my system and reach out to anyone in the team if needed.
                    After a few days, we met again to set our goals. Mine as an employee and his as my boss.
                    We had regular one on ones to keep track of progress. He used to show me the path but not walk along with me.
                    Once I went with one issue and asked how to move forward with that issue?
                    He did not give me a direct solution, but he broke down the problem into many parts and told me to come up with a solution.<br/><br/>

                    <img key={1} src={'blogImages/leader.jpg'} alt="1" width="250" height="200"/> <br/>

                    That day I realized, this is what I want to be. I won’t hurt people, will be updated on their progress, and not make them dependent on me.<br/><br/>

                    Now as I am the mentor for many people I guide them, show them the path, and together try to break their problems. I don’t want to be a boss or helper, I want to be a leader.<br/><br/>
